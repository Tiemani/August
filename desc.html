    <h2>Install Bamboo on Linux</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Download Bamboo:</strong> Download the file for your operating system from <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download" target="_blank">Atlassian Bamboo Download</a>
            <ul>
                <li>tar.gz for MacOS or Linux distributions.</li>
                <li>zip for Windows.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Create the installation directory:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>a) Extract the downloaded file to an install location.</li>
                <li>b) The path to the extracted directory is referred to as the <em>Bamboo installation directory</em> in these instructions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Create the home directory:</strong> Specify your Bamboo home directory, where your Bamboo data is stored, before you run Bamboo for the first time.
            <ul>
                <li>a) Create your Bamboo home directory (without spaces in the name).</li>
                <li>Note: You should not create your Bamboo home directory inside the <em>Bamboo installation directory</em> — they should be entirely separate locations. If you do put the home directory in the <em>Bamboo installation directory</em> it will be overwritten and lost when Bamboo is upgraded.</li>
                <li>b) Open <em><Bamboo installation directory>/atlassian-bamboo/WEB-INF/classes/bamboo-init.properties</em>.</li>
                <li>c) Uncomment the bamboo.home line.</li>
                <li>d) Provide the absolute path to the bamboo-home directory.
                    <pre>bamboo.home=/var/bamboo/bamboo-home</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Start Bamboo:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>a) In the command line, change the directory to <em><Bamboo installation directory></em> and run the commands to start Bamboo:
                    <pre>$ cd <Bamboo installation directory></pre>
                    <pre>$ ./bin/start-bamboo.sh</pre>
                </li>
                <li>b) After successfully starting Bamboo, you will find it online at <a href="http://localhost:8085/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8085/</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Configure Bamboo:</strong> You are starting Bamboo for the first time, so you will need to follow the Setup Wizard to configure Bamboo. See <em>Running the Setup Wizard</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Start using Bamboo:</strong> That's it! Your Bamboo site is accessible from a URL like this: <code>http://&lt;computer_name_or_IP_address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>If you want your Bamboo instance always running:</strong> Check how to run Bamboo as a service.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Installing Bamboo on Windows</h2>

<p>In this guide, we'll run you through installing Bamboo with an external database on Windows.</p>

<h3>Before You Begin</h3>
<p>Before you install Bamboo, there are a few questions you need to answer:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Are you using a supported operating system?</strong> <a href="#">Tell me more...</a></li>
    <li><strong>Is your JAVA_HOME variable set correctly?</strong> <a href="#">Tell me more...</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Install Bamboo</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Download Bamboo:</strong>
        <p>Download Bamboo from the Atlassian download site.</p>
        <p>It is highly recommended to avoid placing the Bamboo home directory in any Windows security-controlled directory, for example, <code>C:\Program Files</code>, <code>C:\Users</code>, <code>C:\Windows</code>.</p>
        <p>Extract the files from the zip archive to a <em>Bamboo installation directory</em> of your choice. By default, the root directory in your zip file is named "Bamboo".</p>
        <p><strong>Warning: Some unzip programs cause errors</strong><br>
        Some archive-extract programs cause errors when unzipping the Bamboo archive file. We highly recommend that you use the free 7Zip archive-extract program (if in doubt, download the '32-bit .exe' version).</p>
        <p>Set up your Bamboo home directory — this is the directory where Bamboo will store its root configuration data. To do this, edit the file named <code>bamboo-init.properties</code> in the <em><Bamboo installation directory>/atlassian-bamboo/WEB-INF/classes/</em> directory. In this file, insert the property <code>bamboo.home</code>, with an absolute path to your Bamboo home directory. Your file should look something like this:</p>
        <pre>bamboo.home=C:/test/bamboo-home</pre>
        <p>Alternatively, you can specify an environment variable <code>BAMBOO_HOME</code> which specifies the absolute path to your Bamboo home directory. Bamboo will check if an environment variable is defined.</p>
        <p>If you are going to use Bamboo remote agents, set the following in the <code>bamboo-init.properties</code> file in the <em><Bamboo installation directory>/atlassian-bamboo/WEB-INF/classes</em> directory:</p>
        <pre>bamboo.jms.broker.uri=tcp://localhost:54663</pre>
        <p>Replace 'localhost' with the real host name or IP address of your Bamboo server. If port number <code>54663</code> is already in use, specify a different port number.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Start Bamboo:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>a) In the command line, change the directory to <em><Bamboo installation directory></em> and run the command to start Bamboo:
                <pre>$ cd <Bamboo installation directory></pre>
                <pre>$ bin\start-bamboo.bat</pre>
            </li>
            <li>b) After successfully starting Bamboo, you will find it online at <a href="http://localhost:8085/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8085/</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Configure Bamboo:</strong>
        <p>You are starting Bamboo for the first time, so you will need to follow the Setup Wizard to configure Bamboo. See <em>Running the Setup Wizard</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Start Using Bamboo:</strong>
        <p>That's it! Your Bamboo site is accessible from a URL like this: <code>http://&lt;computer_name_or_IP_address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>If you want your Bamboo instance always running:</strong> Check how to run Bamboo as a service.</li>
